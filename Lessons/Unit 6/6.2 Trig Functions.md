sine $\to \sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r}$

cosine $\to \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r}$

tangent $\to \tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}$

cosecant $\to \csc(\theta) = \frac{r}{y}$

secant $\to \sec(\theta) = \frac{r}{x}$

cotangent $\to \cot(\theta) = \frac{x}{y}$

$r \to$ radius of the circle

*Notice:*
> Since we always divide the value by the radius, it will always return a value between -1 and 1

#### How trig functions work

Imagine a circle with a radius of 1.
Now imagine we draw a line out from the center of the circle with a given angle $\theta$

*Interactive explanation:* https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gxbtmboagz

The x value of the intercept point is equal to $\cos(\theta)$.
You can also think of this of the distance along the base from 0 to the x value of the intercept point.

Along with this the y value of the intercept point is equal to $\sin(\theta)$
You can also think of this of the distance along the height from 0 to the y value of the intercept point.

The value of $\tan$ is equal to the value of $\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$, giving us a ratio of the two values.

*Notice*:
> If we remember back to our early geometry days we learned that the formula for slope was equal to $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$.
> This rule still applies here, allowing us to find the slope of any angle extremely quickly.
>
>If we recall the distance along the height from 0 to the y value of the intercept point is equal to $\sin(\theta)$, in a way, this sort of acts as our $\Delta y$ as it is the change from 0 to the intercept point's y value.
>The same is also true for $cos(\theta)$ but for the x axis, giving us $\Delta x$.
>
>Combining this into the equation $y = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}x$, we can get the equation:
> $y = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}x$
> 
> If we recall back to our trig identities we can simplify $\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$ into just $\tan(\theta)$, giving us the final form of the equation:
> $y=\tan(\theta)x$
> Allowing us to graph any angle value $\theta$ we'd like!

#### Exact values

When given two points of a circle, $(x_1,y_1)$, we're capable of finding the values the trigonometric functions for the circle.

If we recall we need 3 different values, an x point, a y point, and the radius of the circle, but we're only given an x and a y.

Remember that this point lies on a circle, meaning we can imagine a right triangle inlayed on the circle.

We can recall from geometry that the distance of the hypotenuse of a right triangle will be $a^2+b^2=c^2$

Since the hypotenuse is the distance from 0 to the point, and all points on a circle are equidistant from the center, the $c$ becomes the radius of the circle.
We can then plug in our values and solve for r:
$x_1^2+y_1^2=r^2$
$r = \sqrt{(x_1^2+y_1^2)}$


Now we can create are trig equations.
$\sin \to \frac{y_1}{\sqrt{(x_1^2+y_1^2)}}$
$\cos \to \frac{x_1}{\sqrt{(x_1^2+y_1^2)}}$
$\tan \to \frac{y_1}{x_1}$

$\csc \to \frac{\sqrt{(x_1^2+y_1^2)}}{y_1}$
$\sec \to \frac{\sqrt{(x_1^2+y_1^2)}}{x_1}$
$\cot \to \frac{x_1}{y_1}$

*Notice:*
> If we remember back to our previous algebra classes we can recall that anything to the power of $^{-1}$ flips fraction.
> This is also true for trig functions, meaning $\sin(\theta)^{-1} \to \csc$
> 
> **It's important to note that $\sin^{-1}(\theta)$ is not the same as $\sin(\theta)^{-1}$**
> $\sin^{-1}(\theta)$ is an inverse trig function which will be covered in later units.
