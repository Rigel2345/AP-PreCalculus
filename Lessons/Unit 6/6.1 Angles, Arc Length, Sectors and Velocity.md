##### Symbols
$\theta \to$ *theta*

$\omega \to$ *omega*


#### Conversion formulas
$1°$ degree $\to 60'$ minutes
$1'$ minutes $\to 60''$ seconds

$47.837° \to °\space\space\space'\space\space\space''$
$\lfloor\theta\rfloor \to 47°$
$(\theta -\lfloor\theta\rfloor) * 60 \to 50'$
$\lfloor(\theta -\lfloor\theta\rfloor) * 60\rfloor * 60 \to 13.2''$

$47° 50' 13.2'' \to \theta°$
$d°+\frac{m'}{60}+\frac{s''}{3600}$

Degree $\to$ Radians
$\frac{\pi}{180}$

Radians $\to$ Degrees
$\frac{180}{\pi}$


### Area/Lengths
##### Arc Length
$s = r\theta$
*radians*

$s = \frac{\theta°}{360}*2\pi r$
*degrees*

*Derivation:*
> We're trying to find a percentage of the circumference of the circle to find the arc length.
> This is why we divide $\theta$° by 360°, as this gives us a unitless % of the circle the arc length covers.
> *Notice*:
> A simplified version of $s = \frac{\theta°}{360}*2\pi r$ would be $s = \frac{\theta \pi}{180} * r$
> This is conveniently the same step to convert $°\theta \to radians$
> Thus the equation: $s = r\theta$

##### Area of A Sector
$A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$
*radians*

### Velocity Equations
##### Linear Velocity
$v = \frac{∆s}{∆t}$ or $v=\frac{r}{\omega}$
*radians*
$∆s =$ change in arc length (for a full circle this is $2\pi$)
$∆t =$ time it took to travel ∆s

#### Angular Velocity
$\omega = \frac{∆\theta}{∆t}$
*radians*
$\Delta\theta =$ change in degrees   (for a full circle this is $2\pi$)
$\Delta t =$ time it took to travel $\Delta\theta$



### Practice Problems

p. 392, q. 91
The minute hand of a clock is 6 inches. How far does the tip of the minute hand move in 15 minutes? How long in 25 minutes. *Round to two decimal places*

We need to find the percent of the circle that the tip travels over a given time. We know that there's 60 minutes in an hour and therefore we can find percent of the circle traveled by $\frac{\Delta t}{60}$.
To find the length of the arc we multiply the percent of the circumference by the length of the circumference which gives us the final formula $\frac{\Delta t}{60} * 2 \pi r$

In case 1:
$\frac{15min}{60min} * 2 * \pi * 6in$
$0.25 * 12in * pi$
$3in * \pi$
$9.42in$

In case 2: 
$\frac{25min}{60min} * 2 * \pi * 6in$
$15.71in$

p. 393 q. 113
Two pulleys, one with a radius of 2in and the other with a radius of 8in are connected by a belt.
The 2in pulley is rotated at 3 rpm, determine the rpm of the 8in pulley

3rpm is the angular velocity of the 2in pulley, meaning:
$2in * 3rpm = 8in * \omega$
$\omega * 8in = 6 rpm*in$
$\omega = \frac{6 rpm*in}{8in}$
$\omega = 0.75rpm$

p. 394 q 123
A dog is leashed to a 9ft rope which is fastened to the outside corner of a fenced-in garden that measures 6ft by 10ft. Assuming that the dog may not enter the garden write the exact area in $ft^2$
