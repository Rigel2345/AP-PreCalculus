##### What is a vector?

A vector is a ray with its center at the origin of the coordinate system, meaning it has a length and a direction.

##### Position Vectors
$\vec{v} = <x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1>$

For vector subtraction it's always the terminal point subtracted by the initial point.

Given $\overrightarrow{AB}$ you must subtract them by doing $<b_x-a_x,b_y-a_y>$.

##### Magnitude of a vector
The magnitude of a vector is the distance from the tip away from the origin, or the absolute value.
This is written in a different notation for vectors:

$||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$

---
##### Angle of a vector
The angle of a vector is given by $\tan^{-1}$, if your vector is in quad 2 (x < 0), add 180Â° or $\pi$


---
##### Unit Vectors:
$u = \frac{v}{||v||}$

This is also called normalizing a vector.

Using two unit vectors we can define a coordinate system, these are typically the unit vectors
$<1,0>,<0,1>$ in a cartesian coordinate system.

We call this first vector $\hat{i}$ or "i-hat" and the second vector $\hat{j}$  or "j-hat".

##### Find the vector given direction + Magnitude
$||\vec{v}||(\cos(\theta)\hat{i}+\sin(\theta)\hat{j})$

---
#### Normalizing vectors

A normalized vector is a vector with a direction of $\theta$ and a magnitude of $1$.

A vector can be normalized by dividing by its magnitude, giving us the equation $\vec{\hat{v}}=\frac{\vec{v}}{||\vec{v}||}$
