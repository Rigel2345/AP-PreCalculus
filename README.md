Hello! Welcome to my collection of AP-Precalculus notes for the 2024 Spring semester.

Feel free to roam around this repository using GitHub's web viewer or follow the instructions below to set up this repository in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

> GitHub has several issues displaying files and will generally have a less satisfying experience, if you think you'll use this repository a lot or feel like you could contribute to this repository, consider setting it up locally on your computer (MacOS, Windows, Linux only, no ChromeOS).

Please note I use 'vault' and 'repository' fairly interchangeably.
- Vault refers to the Obsidian's system of holding and organizing notes together.
- Repository refers to GitHub's system of holding and organizing files, see the note above.
