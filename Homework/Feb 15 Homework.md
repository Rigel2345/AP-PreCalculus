Q24: $A$ denotes the area of the sector of a circle of radius $r$ formed by the central angle $\theta$. Find the missing quantity.

$\theta = \frac{1}{10} rad$ , $A = 12 cm^2$, $r=?$

Equation:
$A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$

Re-arrange to solve for r
$2A = r^2\theta$
$\frac{2A}{\theta} = r^2$
$\sqrt[2]{\frac{2A}{\theta}} = r$

Substitute:

$\sqrt[2]{\frac{2(12cm^2)}{\frac{1}{10}rad}} = r$
$\sqrt[2]{\frac{(24cm^2)}{\frac{1}{10}rad}} = r$
$\sqrt[2]{240cm^2} = r$
$15.492cm \approx r$


A dog is attached to a 39-foot rope fastened to the outside corner of a​ fenced-in garden that measures 36 feet by 40 feet. Assuming that the dog cannot enter the​ garden, compute the exact area that the dog can wander.

Find total area dog can roam:
$A = \pi*39^2ft$
$A = \pi1521ft^2$

Find area of portion not related to the garden
$A = \pi1521ft^2 * \frac{3}{4}$

For the upper section we can imagine a smaller circle with a radius of 3 at the corner, representing the 3ft of slack on the line at this point

Find area of smaller circle
$A_{small} = \pi3^2ft$
$A_{small} = \pi9ft^2$

Find section of the smaller circle we want
*This will include removing the portion of the wall we don't want $\frac{1}{4}$ and the portion covered by the large circle, $\frac{1}{2}$. This will leave us with $\frac{1}{4}$ of the circle*

Find effective area of smaller circle
$A_{small} = \pi9ft^2 * \frac{1}{4}$

Add the two areas
$A_{total} = \pi9ft^2 * \frac{1}{4} + \pi1521ft^2 * \frac{3}{4}$
$A_{total} = \pi2.25ft^2+\pi1140.75ft^2$
$A_{total} = \pi1143ft^2$
